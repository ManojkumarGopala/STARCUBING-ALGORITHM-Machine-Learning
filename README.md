# STARCUBING-ALGORITHM-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Algorithms
Data cube computation is essential task in data warehouse implementation. The
precomputation of all or part of a data cube can greatly reduce the response time and enhance the
performance of on-line analytical processing. In this project, we present Star- Cubing, that
integrates the strengths of the previous algorithms and performs aggregations on multiple
dimensions simultaneously. It utilizes a star-tree structure, extends the simultaneous aggregation
methods, and enables the pruning of the group-byâ€™s that do not satisfy the iceberg condition.
